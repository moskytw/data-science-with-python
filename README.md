# Data Science With Python

“Data science” is a big term; however, we will still try to capture all of the topics in this course, hoping to be the lighthouse pointing the way which resolves problems concretely.

We will cover the clarification of confusing terminology, the analysis steps, basic and statistical plotting, pandas and numpy, how to reduce variables, statistical hypothesis testing and regression, machine learning classification and clustering. Moreover, all of the above are introduced in plain Python.

It won't have all details, but will include most of the keywords and the links.

It was also a course in PyLadies Taiwan in 2017/12 and 2018 NCCU PyDay.
