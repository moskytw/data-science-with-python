# Data Science With Python

“Data science” is a big term; however, we will still try to capture all of the topics in this course, hoping to be the lighthouse pointing the way which resolves problems concretely.

We will cover the clarification of confusing terminology, the analysis steps, basic and statistical plotting, pandas and numpy, how to reduce variables, statistical hypothesis testing and regression, machine learning classification and clustering. Moreover, all of the above are introduced in plain Python.

It won't have all details, but will include most of the keywords and the links.

The notebooks are available on https://github.com/moskytw/data-science-with-python .
